## Acme Web Design

In the developing world, technology is advancing rapidly and we encounter devices with different sizes of screens. 
Depending on these developing needs, it has become an imperative to adapt the websites we will make to screens of different sizes.

In this project, you can first find a sample of a website using the semantic layout and you can see how you can harmonize all different screens a site with the media query css feature.

I created a separate branch for each semantic layout element. You can see every stage by checking each branch and you can also click [here](https://github.com/oguzkarademir/acme-web-design/blob/master/development-strategy.md) and look my development strategy.
